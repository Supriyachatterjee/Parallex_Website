# Parallex_Website

About
Our project is a cool website that uses special effects to make it look 3D and interactive. When you scroll, things on the page move in different ways, creating depth and making it feel alive.

What's Special
3D Look: We make elements on the page look like they're popping out or moving in a 3D space.
Cool Scrolling: As you scroll, background and foreground elements move at different speeds, giving a unique and dynamic feel.

How to Use
Just open the website in your browser and start scrolling! Explore the different sections to see the cool effects in action.

Technology Used
We used simple web technologies like HTML and CSS (including 3D transforms) to make it all work smoothly.
